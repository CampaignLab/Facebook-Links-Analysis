# Facebook-Links-Analysis
Project to analyse Facebook Group Campaigning Links
**Labour Local Facebook Group Campaigning Data analysis ðŸ“ˆ**
Currently a number of activists across 80 areas are experimenting with campaigning in local facebook groups. We have a database of over 1000 links to these types of posts. What information can we scrape from these posts (ie reactions, engagements, sentiment). How can we analyse the data from these posts to learn more about what might be working?
